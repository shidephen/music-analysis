<H2>BeatRoot Usage</H2>

<H3>Command Line Options</H3>
<FONT face=courier>
java -cp beatroot-0.5.7.jar at.ofai.music.beatroot.BeatRoot [ options ]
</FONT>
<P>
BeatRoot may be run in GUI (graphical user interface) or batch mode.
The graphical mode is the default if no options are given.
In graphical mode, parameter settings are adjusted with the Preferences menu
item in the Edit Menu.
The command line options are described in the online documentation at:<BR>
<a href="doc/at/ofai/music/beatroot/BeatRoot.html#processArgs(java.lang.String[])">
http://www.elec.qmul.ac.uk/people/simond/beatroot/doc/at/music/beatroot/BeatRoot.html#processArgs(java.lang.String[])
</a>. Other parameters and preferences can only be adjusted by modifying the source
code.</P>

<H3>File formats</H3>
The range of accepted audio file types are those accepted by the JavaSound
implementation, including any installed extension libraries.
In any case, standard WAV format files, 1 or 2 channel 16-bit linear PCM encoded,
at any sampling rate, are accepted. If BeatRoot doesn't accept your file format,
convert it with a utility like <FONT face=courier><B>sox</B></FONT>.
 
<H3>Text output</H3>
BeatRoot can output the beat times in text format (see the "-o" command line
option), or in text-MIDI format (the format produced by the program
<FONT face=courier><B>mf2t</B></FONT> which is available
<a href="http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/mf2t/download.shtml">here</a>.
If using the debugging output, 
each line contains the beat number, the inter-beat
interval in parentheses, the beat time (in square brackets if there was no
event on the beat), and finally the remaining event times (if any) up to
(but not including) the next beat.

<H3>BeatRoot Graphical User Interface Overview</H3>

<p>You might want to start by reading the
<a href="../pub/2001/icmc.pdf">ICMC paper</a>
to get an overview of the system.
The user interface of the current version is quite similar.</p>

<p>Click on <B>Load Audio Data</B> and select an audio file.
You should see the file in spectrogram and amplitude envelope displays
when the system has finished processing the file (it will probably take
about 10% of the duration of the audio).
Click on <B>Track Beats</B> to perform beat tracking.
You should then see the beats
marked on the display with black vertical lines.
You can listen to the beats and audio with the three different
play buttons: <B>Play with beats</B> plays the audio with clicks at
the times of each beat; <B>Play without beats</B> plays the original
audio file, and <B>Play beats only</B> plays the beats without the
audio.</p>

<p>Errors can be corrected using the mouse:
the <B>left button</B> moves beats,
the <B>middle button</B> adds new beats and
the <B>right button</B> deletes beats.</p>

<H3>Detailed description of GUI components and controls</H3>
The graphical user interface consists of a data panel with
a menu bar above it, and a scroll bar and button panel below it.
The data display consists of the following components:
<UL>
<LI>Time line: at the bottom of the data display is a time axis, showing
the time in seconds from the beginning of the input data.
<LI>Amplitude envelope: the amplitude envelope is shown
in purple, calculated from an RMS average of a 20ms window of audio data,
with 50% overlap between successive windows (default parameter settings).
<LI>Onset times: short green vertical lines mark detected note onset times.
<LI>Spectrogram: a spectrogram of the audio data is shown above the
amplitude envelope in various shades of yellow, orange, red, white and
black. If it looks too white or too black, set the lower and upper
thresholds under Preferences in the Edit Menu. 
<LI>Beat times: black vertical lines mark the times of beats,
as computed by BeatRoot or edited by the user.
<LI>Inter-beat intervals: the times between pairs of beats are shown
(in milliseconds) at the top of the data display. The default
resolution is 5 milliseconds per pixel, although
the onset detection algorithm only has a resolution of 10ms by default.
</UL>
The mouse is used to edit the beat times on the data display as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Use the left mouse button to move beats by clicking on a beat line and
dragging it to the desired location.
<LI>Use the middle mouse button to add a new beat at the cursor location.
<LI>Use the right mouse button to delete a beat at the cursor location.
<LI>By clicking with the left mouse button on the time axis,
you can select a region of the music. A single click will select from
the current point to the end of the file. The selected region is highlighted
in grey-pink in the area above the time line. A region bounded at both ends
can be selected by clicking at one end and dragging to the other end.
The selected region can be
cleared by clicking the right mouse button on the time axis.
</UL>
The control panel consists of the following components:
<UL>
<LI><B>Options:</B> this field is current not used.  Any options
must be specified on the command line or via the Preferences in the
Edit menu
<LI><B>View Range:</B> this is the number of seconds of data
that are visible on the screen.
It is possible to zoom in or out using the <B>+</B> and <B>-</B>
buttons respectively, or by entering a value in the text field between
the two buttons.
<LI><B>Load Audio Data</B> button: load a new audio file.
A window will appear which allows you to select the data file.
This will clear any currently loaded audio data.
For large data files, you will
have to wait a few seconds while the data is processed.
<LI><B>Clear beats</B> button: delete the beats in the highlighted
region, or delete all beats if no region is selected.
<LI><B>Load Beat Data</B> button: load a file of beat times
(assumed to be one you previously saved using BeatRoot).
The format is a text version of the MIDI format (compatible with the
program t2mf), containing a drum track marking the beats.
<LI><B>Track beats</B> button: performs beat tracking on the
highlighted region, or on the whole file if no region is selected.
If a region is selected, the tempo and phase of beats before the
selected region will be used as the basis for further beats.
If you plan to edit the file and re-track sections of it, it is best if
manual editing is performed in chronological order,
i.e. from the beginning to the end of the file.
<LI><B>Undo</B> button: restores the previous
list of beats after the most recent change.
<LI><B>Redo</B> button: undoes the undo.
<LI><B>Save Beat Data</B> button: saves the beat times
in text MIDI format.
<LI><B>Play without beats</B> button: plays the input audio data.
<LI><B>Play beats only</B> button: plays the beat times with a
percussion instrument.
<LI><B>Play with beats</B> button: plays the input data with a
percussion instrument sounding at each beat time. The percussion
instrument can be selected with Edit Percussion Sounds in the 
Edit menu.
<LI><B>Stop</B> button: stop the playback.
<LI><B>Exit</B> button: end the program.

<H2>BeatRoot Parameter Settings</H2>

BeatRoot uses default values for all parameters, chosen to give reasonable
performance across a range of data. For specific data sets, alternative
parameter settings can be specified on the command line, the options field of
the graphical user interface, or in a parameter file.
On startup, the system reads the file
<FONT face=courier>~/.beatrootrc</FONT>,
then any parameter file specified with the
<FONT face=courier>-P</FONT> option,
then the command line parameters (assuming they come after the
<FONT face=courier>-P</FONT> option),
and finally any settings in the options field of the GUI.
If a parameter is set more than once, the later setting overrides the earlier
value.
Parameter settings are always of the form:<BR>
<em>parameter</em>=<em>value</em><BR>
with no spaces. In files, each parameter setting is on a line by itself;
in the text box, successive settings are separated by spaces, and on the 
command line, the parameter settings are preceded by two minus signs
and separated by spaces. Warning: parameter names are case sensitive.
<P>
Input parameters:
<UL>
<LI><B>start</B> (type: double; default value: 0)<BR>
Start time in seconds relative to the beginning of the file.
<LI><B>length</B> (type: double; default value: -1)<BR>
Length of input data to be loaded, in seconds. -1 indicates `to end of file'.
<LI><B>format</B> (type: string; default value: <em>none</em>)<BR>
Not necessary if the input file has the expected extension (see above).
Otherwise this parameter should specify one of the following formats:
wav, snd, mid, tmf, match.
<LI><B>channels</B> (type: string; default value: add)<BR>
What to do with a 2-channel input file. The choices are:
add (create a 1-channel file containing the sum of the 2 channels),
subtract (create a 1-channel file containing the difference of the 2 channels),
both (keep both channels unchanged),
left (create a 1-channel file consisting of only the left channel of the input)
and right
(create a 1-channel file consisting of only the right channel of the input).
</UL>
<P>
Output parameters:
<UL>
<LI><B>play</B> (type: string; default value: on)<BR>
Used in batch mode to select whether audio output should be sent to the
sound card. Choices: on, off.
<LI><B>audioOut</B> (type: string; default value: <em>none</em>)<BR>
Used in batch mode to select a file name for saving audio output.
By default, audio output is played but not saved.
<LI><B>stereo</B> (type: string; default value: on)<BR>
Selects the output format of audio data. Choices: on (input data and beats
appear on separate channels; incompatible with channels=both), off (input data
is mixed with beats on the same channel(s)).
<LI><B>metronome</B> (type: string; default value: <em>useless</em>)<BR>
This is used to select the click sound used to mark the beats in audio output.
This should be an audio file containing a single percussion stroke with onset
as close as possible to the beginning of the file.
A suitable file (33-metclick.wav) is provided with BeatRoot.
Set this parameter to the full path name of this file.
<LI><B>clickTrackOnly</B> (type: string; default value: <em>not used</em>)<BR>
File name for saving an audio track consisting of clicks at times of
detected onsets. Not particularly useful, except in demonstrations
(hearing the audio world from the system's point of view).
<LI><B>midiOut</B> (type: string; default value: <em>none</em>)<BR>
Used in batch mode to specify the file name for saving MIDI output
(i.e. input data + beats).
<LI><B>tmfDefaults</B> (type: string; default value: see below)<BR>
Parameter settings for MIDI output, in TMF format, placed at the beginning
of the MIDI output file.
By default, this is used so that MIDI channel 1 is panned left,
and MIDI channel 10 (the beat track) is panned right.
<LI><B>midiMetronome</B> (type: int; default value: 56)<BR>
This is used to select the click sound used to mark the beats in MIDI output.
It specifies the note number used in the MIDI output for beats.
The standard drum kit settings have many possible sounds, for example:
sticks (31), thud (32), metronome (33), metronome with bell (34), cowbell (56),
woodblock (76, 77), muted triangle (80) and open triangle (81).
</UL>
Beat induction parameters:
<UL>
<LI><B>clusterWidth</B> (type: double; default value: 0.025)<BR>
Used in the clustering algorithm; in seconds.
<LI><B>minCluster</B> (type: double; default value: 0.070)<BR>
Used in the clustering algorithm; the smallest cluster interval, in seconds.
<LI><B>maxCluster</B> (type: double; default value: 2.500)<BR>
Used in the clustering algorithm; the largest cluster interval, in seconds.
<LI><B>minIBI</B> (type: double; default value: 0.250)<BR>
The minimum inter-beat interval (maximum tempo), in seconds.
0.250 sec/beat = 240 BPM.
<LI><B>maxIBI</B> (type: double; default value: 0.750)<BR>
The maximum inter-beat interval (minimum tempo), in seconds.
0.750 sec/beat = 80 BPM.
<LI><B>hopSize</B> (type: double; default value: 0.010)<BR>
Time resolution for beat induction of audio, in seconds.
<LI><B>overlap</B> (type: int; default value: 2)<BR>
The number of hops in a frame: FrameSize = overlap * hopSize.
FrameSize is the window size for calculating the amplitude envelope of audio
data.
<LI><B>peakWidth</B> (type: int; default value: 5)<BR>
Minimum gap between onsets, expressed as a multiple of the hopSize:
Peak separation = peakWidth * hopSize.
<LI><B>thresholdFactor</B> (type: double; default value: 10.0)<BR>
Used to reject peaks in the slope of the amplitude envelope which have
an amplitude less than the average amplitude divided by thresholdFactor.
</UL>
Beat tracking parameters:
<UL>
<LI><B>innerMargin</B> (type: double; default value: 0.040)<BR>
Used in beat tracking algorithm; in seconds. Should be less than
IBI * preMarginFactor and IBI * postMarginFactor.
<LI><B>preMarginFactor</B> (type: double; default value: 0.2)<BR>
Specifies, as a fraction of the IBI, how early (before its predicted time)
a beat can be.
<LI><B>postMarginFactor</B> (type: double; default value: 0.4)<BR>
Specifies, as a fraction of the IBI, how late (after its predicted time)
a beat can be.
<LI><B>correctionFactor</B> (type: double; default value: 50.0)<BR>
Controls how much an agent's tempo estimate is modified by beats off
the predicted beat time. The tempo hypothesis is adjusted by
(predictedTime - actualTime) / correctionFactor.
<LI><B>expiryTime</B> (type: double; default value: 5.0)<BR>
Specifies how long an agent survives (in seconds) when it finds no event
corresponding to its beat prediction. If you get the message
`Beat tracking failed', it is usually due to this value being too low.
For example, a 5 second silence in any piece of music will cause all agents
to give up, and beat tracking to fail, assuming the default expiryTime.
<LI><B>averageSalience</B> (type: string; default value: off)<BR>
Specifies whether the agents' evaluation function
is based on the sum (off) or average (on) of adjusted salience values.
</UL>
MIDI beat tracking parameters:
<UL>
<LI><B>mergeWidth</B> (type: double; default value: 0.070)<BR>
Specifies the window size in seconds
within which notes are grouped as a single rhythmic event.

Specifies the type of salience calculation. Choices:
additive, multiplicative, constant.
<LI><B>durationWeight</B> (type: double; default value: 300.0)<BR>
Specifies the weight given to duration in the salience calculation.
<LI><B>pitchWeight</B> (type: double; default value: 4.0)<BR>
Specifies the weight given to pitch in the salience calculation.
<LI><B>salienceFilter</B> (type: double; default value: <em>not used</em>)<BR>
Specifies a salience threshold, below which rhythmic events are considered
non-salient.
<LI><B>normaliseSalience</B> (type: string; default value: off)<BR>
Specifies whether salience calculations should be normalised by a local average.
Choices: on, off.
